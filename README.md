# Multiclass-classification-Using-Auto-dataset

The binary classification, where there were only 2 possible categories, or classes. When we have 3 or more categories, we call the problem a multiclass classification problem.

Using the one-versus-all method technique where we choose a single category as the Positive case and group the rest of the categories as the False case. 

Splitting the problem into multiple binary classification problems. For each observation, the model will then output the probability of belonging to each category.
